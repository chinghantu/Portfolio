				<h2>Interview Methodlogy</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-9">
				<p>
					Because we were a group of 6 people, we had the opportunity to interview a wide range of people all over campus. Our group ended up conducting interviews in pairs with 18 participants and went to locations such as Price Center, Geisel Library, and study lounges. One person would lead the interview and ask questions, while the second person would observe the participant and jot down notes.<br><br>
					
					We knew that the way we worded questions would have a direct impact on how the participants would answer, so we made sure to ask open-ended questions. We also tried to write questions without imposing our own biases into it. The pre-activity questions let us gauge what kind of transit apps participants use regularly and whether or not they have experience with the app.<br><br>
					
					<b>Pre-Activity Questions</b><br>
					1. What transit apps do you use?<br>
					- If you do not use any, why?<br>
					2. What transit apps do you use?<br>
					3. When was the last time you used a transit app?<br>
					- What was it and for what purpose?<br>
					4. Have you used the One Bus Away app before?<br>
					- If yes, Android or iOS version?<br><br>
					
					After asking the pre-activity questions, we informed the participants that we wanted to conduct an activity to observe how they interacted with the app. We followed the master apprentice model, and treated the participants as if they were knowledgeable and experts on the One Bus Away app to make them feel more in control. This way, we would also be able to fully observe how they naturally interact with the app. The goal of the activity is to see whether or not users could perform simple tasks related to the search feature that would be used on a daily basis.<br><br>
					
					Throughout the activity, we noted which steps the participants struggled with so that we could revisit it in the post-activity questions. We also screen recorded participants doing the activity to better analyze their interactions with the app.<br><br>
					
					<b>Activity</b><br>
					Assume the closest stop is Gilman Transit Center<br>
					1. Find the quickest way to Westfield UTC<br>
					2. When is the next 201 bus coming to the Gilman Transit Center stop?<br>
					3. Find a bus that gets you from campus to La Jolla Shores<br>
					- How many minutes away is that bus?<br>
					- Count the number of stops to La Jolla Shores<br>
					4. Change region to Washington D.C.<br>
					- You are at the White House. Find the quickest way to Washington Union Station.<br><br>
					
					After participants completed the activity, we asked them the post-activity questions to see what they thought of the app and whether or not they would use it again. Furthermore, we brought up the steps we noted that the participants had a hard time with and asked them to go through their thought process during that step. This allowed us to better understand their mental model of the app.<br><br>
					
					<b>Post-Activity Questions</b><br>
					1. How was your experience with One Bus Away?<br>
					2. We noticed you had troubles with step –. Could you describe what was going on in your mind or why you think you made those errors?<br>
					3. After this experience, would you use One Bus Away? Why or why not?<br>
					4. Compare One Bus Away with the apps you frequently use.<br><br>

				<h2>Major Insights</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-9">
				<p>
					From analyzing the data we collected, we found major problems and trends.<br><br>
					
					1. <b>18/18</b> participants initially typed in the destination (Westfield UTC) into the search bar<br>
					- <b>Knowledge-based mistake</b><br>
					- When users click on the search bar, the phrase “Type in an address, route number, or stop number here to search” pops up. It is important to note that the designer’s conceptual model of “route” refers to the bus number (e.g. 30, 150, 201), while “address” refers to the starting location. As such, users of the app are expected to find bus routes by only entering a bus number, starting location, or stop number.<br>
					- Because of the gap between the designer’s conceptual model and the user’s mental model, participants were unable to correctly use the search bar due to knowledge deficits. <br>
					2. Once users typed in Westfield UTC (the destination) in the search bar, <b>5/18</b> participants tapped “route,” while <b>13/18</b> tapped “address”. <br>
					- The participants who had tapped “route” or “address” both thought that they would see bus routes from their current location to the destination that they had typed in. However, the ones who had selected “route” got a pop up message saying “No stops at this location” because the app was expecting the user to enter in a bus number, not a word.<br>
					- It is misleading to say “No stops at this location” since after seeing that message, <b>1/5</b> participants who had tapped “route” just typed in a different variation of Westfield UTC (e.g. University Town Center), <b>2/5</b> went back and tapped “address,” while the remaining <b>2/5</b> just gave up on the task. From this, it is evident that all 5 participants did not understand that they are actually supposed to enter in a bus number. This suggests a large gulf of evaluation because the message does not explain to these users what caused their mistake and why their action was incorrect. Instead, the designer should have used a message saying “Error: Please type in a bus number.”<br>
					3. <b>13/18</b> interviewees who clicked on “address”after typing in Westfield UTC were directed to it on the map.<br>
					- Of these 13 participants, <b>10</b> noticed that their mental model of typing in a destination was wrong because the bus routes that showed up all started from Westfield UTC, which was supposed to be the destination. As such, these 10 participants typed in Gilman Transit Center instead and were able to find all possible bus routes from Gilman to Westfield UTC.<br>
					- A trend that we found in step 1 was those <b>10</b> participants were unable to identify the most efficient route to take. The app tells users when the nearest bus will arrive at the bus stop, but does not immediately tell users when the bus will stop at the destination.<br>
					- For example, just because the 101 bus comes 2 minutes before the 202 bus does not mean that it would get to Westfield UTC faster. The only way for participants to figure out which bus would arrive to the destination first would be to manually tap into each bus and scroll to see when each bus would arrive at the Westfield UTC bus stop. When we asked participants to find the quickest way to Westfield UTC, <b>all 10</b> participants just selected the bus that arrived at the Gilman Transit Center first.<br>
					4. <b>13/18</b> participants mentioned in their interview that they thought the app looked extremely cluttered.<br>
					- This is because the home screen of the map has an icon for every bus stop in the surrounding area.<br><br>

					The main issue, however, was that the search bar was not intuitive. A more flexible search bar is required to address the user’s mental model and accommodate for the user’s inputs. Currently, the app’s search bar is poorly designed, and our participants’ inability to accomplish tasks efficiently or at all proves that the designer’s conceptual model is quite different the user’s mental model.<br><br>
					
					Given these issues, we wanted to bridge the designer’s conceptual model and the user’s mental model through our redesign. Our hope is to allow users to find efficient routes in less time even without prior knowledge of any bus routes in any given region. This is the main purpose of the app, but judging from our interviews, the current search bar impedes users from finding efficient bus routes. Thus, we decided upon redesigning the search bar.<br><br>
					
					<b>Develop</b><br>
					In the develop phase of the <b>double diamond model</b> of design, we came up with a list of possible solutions to make the search bar easier to use:<br>
					- search start and end location<br>
					- explain what each search option means, eg define “route”, “address”<br>
					- choose which bus stop manually first<br>
					- search anything in the search bar, categorize results into bus stops and bus routes<br>
					- more filter options to find the right bus<br>
					- give estimated travel times<br>
					- provide more accurate error messages<br>
					- show all possible routes from start to end location<br>
					- display ranking of all possible routes according to preference (from filter options)<br>
					- display ranking of all possible routes from fastest to slowest<br>
					- include option of showing multiple buses in one route<br>
					- include walking directions— not just start to end bus stops but start to end locations<br><br>
					
					<b>Paper Prototyping</b><br>
					After coming up with the list of solutions, we transitioned onto paper and roughly sketched out what each function would look like on the app. From there, we established three different iterations of a redesigned search bar. After solidifying our thoughts onto paper, we then used Sketch to create high-fidelity mockups of our three redesigns.<br>

					The original search bar limits the search options to three different categories: route, address, or stop number. The wording of each of these options, as seen from our data, confuses users. There is a lack of signifiers explaining what function each option affords, so users continually make mistakes when searching for their desired destinations.<br><br>
					
					In redesign 1, we wanted to see if redefining the search options would allow users to have a better understanding of what each option does. To do this, we changed the three options (route, address, and stop number) to two options: a starting location and a bus number. The wording of the options is much better than the original because “starting location” indicates that users should enter the bus stop where they would get on the bus, and “bus number” indicates that users should enter a specific bus number like “202” or “201”.<br>

					In the original search bar, users were allowed to type their search query before selecting a search option. In this redesign, we reversed this process to ensure that users knew what specific input was required. The remaining screens show the same information as the original app, but we’ve redesigned it to make it look less cluttered. In the third screen (see right), for example, the buses are labelled differently than before and allows users to clearly identify the most important information: which bus is coming next and when it will be here.<br><br>
					
					Redefining specific search options and adding instructions for each option (“type in a starting location/ bus number”) in this redesign increases the discoverability of the app’s affordances. Decluttering also increases the compactness of the app, opting for a more clean and aesthetic look. In this redesign, users are able to easily search up a bus stop or number and clearly identify when the next bus is coming. However, it doesn’t effectively allow users to find the most efficient bus routes from point A to point B without any prior knowledge of specific stops or bus numbers to search for. Thus, we moved onto redesign 2.<br><br>
					
					<b>Redesign 2</b><br>

				<img src="Image/One Bus Away/pasted-image-0.png" alt="image" class="center" style="height:250px;">
				<p>
					<br><br>
					This redesign focuses on finding the most efficient routes from a starting to an end location. After tapping the search bar on the home screen, the first screen on the left shows up. Users are prompted to enter a start and end location, and when tapping into each bar, users are able to enter any location, instead of a specific bus stop like before. A map shows up of the searched location and displays five surrounding bus stops. Users will select one of the bus stops to become the starting bus stop, and repeat the same process to select the ending bus stop. After confirming their selection, a list of all possible routes, ranked from fastest to slowest, is displayed.<br><br>
					
					The visibility of the app, or the amount of information available to the users, increases with this redesign because the closest stops to the searched location is displayed. The user flow is similar to redesign 1’s, where instructions for search entries are given to the users before they start typing for locations. This allows the users to understand what information the search bar is capable of processing and allows the users to understand the designer’s conceptual model a bit better.<br><br>
					
					This redesign tackles the main issue of users not being able to find efficient routes. The list of bus routes going from the start location to the end location not only allows users to see all the possible routes they could take, but also gives an estimated travel time, estimated wait time, and ranks these optional routes from fastest to slowest. Providing these extra bits of information also increases the visibility of the app while allowing users to find efficient routes much faster than the original design.<br><br>
					
					The compactness is improved as well, given that the information displayed is organized and easily identifiable. The issue with redesign 2, however, is that some specific stops would not have any buses leading to other specific stops. If this is the case, users would need to repeat the process of selecting bus stops over and over again until the starting bus stop has buses going to the ending bus stop. To address this issue, we moved onto redesign 3.<br><br>
					
					<b>Final Redesign</b><br>

					<br><br>
					The final redesign introduces essentially an all-encompassing search bar. It’s flexible and allows users to search up any destination. This assumes that users would only use the search bar to find a specific destination.<br><br>
					
					We believe that this is a safe assumption to make because 18/18 of our participants searched up the destination “Westfield UTC” from our interviews in order to find a bus that takes them to UTC. Clearly, the user’s mental model of the search bar includes the affordance of searching up the destination. In this redesign, after users enter a location, the app automatically finds efficient routes from the starting location to the entered destination. The starting location is the user’s current location by default, but could be changed by tapping on the green bubble marked as “Current Location”. The destination could be changed in the same way if users wanted to search for another destination. Again, the routes are ranked from the most efficient to the least, allowing users to choose which route they would like to take. After clicking into a selected route, specific instructions are given to guide users from their starting location all the way to the end location.<br><br>
					
					One major difference from the previous design is the starting and ending points. In previous designs, including the original, the starting and end points were always bus stops. However, in our final redesign, the starting and end points are now locations such as “Goody’s Market”. Specific directions would guide users from these locations to the bus stops, providing not only bus information but also walking directions. We made this change because setting locations as starting and end points makes the app even more user-friendly than before, since the user’s mental model of using the app is to get from location A to location B. This can be seen through the participants’ actions of searching “Westfield UTC” into the search bar instead of “UTC Transit Center”, the name of the bus stop at UTC. The designer’s conceptual model is to display the bus information from bus stop A to bus stop B, but this does not match up the user’s intentions of using the app. By allowing users to enter specific locations, our final redesign successfully closes the gap between the user’s mental model and the designer’s conceptual model. The list of efficient routes would encompass all surrounding bus stops from the starting and end locations, factoring in estimated wait and walking times outside of the overall bus travel time.<br><br>
					
					We settled on this redesign as the final design because it increases visibility, increases discoverability, and increases compactness. Visibility is increased because users can know the best and fastest routes to take. Information about estimated travel times, estimated wait, and specific walking directions are given to ensure that users get to the right destination. This redesign carries the most useful information without sacrificing the overall compactness of the app. The abundance of information is organized well and displayed in a clear manner. The use of color contributes to presenting the information in a organized and decluttered way. Users are able to identify key information fairly quickly because they are always highlighted, bolded, or bigger than the other text. By adding a button for changing locations, users can also clearly identify which region the app is currently searching in. Ultimately, discoverability is increased in this redesign. We eliminated multiple search options and prompted users with only one instruction: “Type in a destination”. This eliminates any confusion or misunderstanding about different types of search options because now, there is only one possible way to find an efficient route. Users can now easily understand what to type into the search bar and what information they will obtain in doing so. With the addition of the button for changing regions, users are able to better distinguish the geographical limitations of the app’s services, as opposed to randomly zooming in and out on the map, hoping that bus routes would magically appear.<br><br>
					
					<b>Limitation</b><br>
					There is perhaps one trade-off with this design: a flexible search bar requires a complex algorithm of identifying locations that would be costly to develop. In our final design, high discoverability and high visibility also comes with low affordability. This redesign would require grouping bus stops to locations instead of simply matching specific inputs like before. For example, when searching for “Fashion Valley”, all the surrounding bus stops at Fashion Valley would be calculated into the possible route options. Each bus stop would need to be re-defined to be included into all possible search terms, and this algorithm would require a lot of effort to develop. However, the process of searching up a bus route in this redesign is so intuitive and user-friendly that we think it is worth the time, effort, and money to adopt our redesign.<br><br>
